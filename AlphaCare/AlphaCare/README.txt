1. "template" pattern
found with RecordView and EditableView as abstract classes and CreateRecordView, EditRecordView, and ViewRecordView as subclasses

User Interface Patterns:

1. "structured format" pattern
found in EditableView with the 3-box SSN entry (with limited text space for each box and dashes between) and 2-box address entry
