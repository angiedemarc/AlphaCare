We have implemented our first complete use case for our application, AlphaCare. 

Our complete use case for our application is creating a record - the details for logging in as well as creating a new record is listed below. 

In order to login, here's a list of users as well as their respective passwords and title:
1. User: CJones45, Password: ghdjuei34, Role: Admin
2. User: AMira, Password: uejdnh36!, Role: Patient
3. User: MBuchle, Password: ujks3456, Role: Doctor
4. User: a, Password: z, Role: Patient

In order to create a new record, you would have to provide an existing patient ID. Here's a list of the existing patient IDs below:
1. 1234
2. 4321
3. 5678

All of this should work following our instructions listed in this text file. Should you have any questions, feel free to message any of our team members on Canvas and we can assist you!
